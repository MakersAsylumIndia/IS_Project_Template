#ðŸ“˜ Welcome to the IS Project Documentation Template!
Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

This repository is your home for documenting your Innovation School Project & starting your maker portfolio.
Youâ€™ll be using the GitHub Wiki to update all your project details in a structured format.

ðŸ§  What to Do First
Start by writing a brief introduction to your project right here in this README.md file:

ðŸ”¹ What problem are you solving?
ðŸ”¹ Whatâ€™s your proposed solution?

Just 2â€“3 lines are enough. This helps others quickly understand what your project is about.

ðŸ›  Where to Document Everything Else
Weâ€™ve already created a standard set of Wiki pages for your project in this repository â€” you just need to update them with the correct information.

Please go through these links on how to edit your GITHUB Wiki Pages
